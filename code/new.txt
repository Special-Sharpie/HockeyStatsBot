HockeyStats version: 1.4.0

HockeyStats bot is now verified on discord! Big thanks to everyone who added the bot to their server, we are now sitting in over 120 servers!
You may have noticed, we have a logo now! It was time to put a face to the name!

HS-singleStat is intended to replace the dedicated single stat commands (Pgoals, Gwins, etc.). They will remain active until version 1.5 at the latest.
HS-perGame was poorly documented on upon release in version 1.3.0, this was improved.

We are on github now! Better late then never right? Link to the repo: https://github.com/Special-Sharpie/HockeyStatsBot

Command Updates:
    No commands changed this time around, just some clean up and support for the Seattle Krakens.

New features:
    - HS-statLeader: Returns the highest scorers of the requested stat from high to low, takes the team abbreviation, how many places (top 10, top 5 etc) and the stat, which defaults to points. Example: HS_statLeaders CGY 10 goals
    - HS-ATplayerStats: Returns the career stats of all active and unactive NHL players. Similar to skaterCareer, only with less data and support for goalies. Example: HS-ATplayerStats JaromeIginla
    - HS-singleStat: Returns a single requested stat. Takes 3 parameters, a player name, a stat code, and a season. Season is optional, defaulting to the current season. Example: HS-singleStat BlakeColeman faceOffPct 20202021. Use HS-statCodes for all stat codes.
    - HS-perGame: Returns a player's stat over total games played. Takes two parameters, a player, and a stat. Example: HS-perGame EliasLindholm points. Use HS-statCodes for all stat codes.
    - HS-statCodes: Sends the stat codes for perGame and singleStat by direct message to the requesting user.
    - HS-commandHistory - Sends the requesting a user a JSON file with all the command attempts after version 1.4.0.
