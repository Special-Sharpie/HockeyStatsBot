HockeyStats version: 2.0.0

HockeyStats bot is now verified on discord! Big thanks to everyone who added the bot to their server, we are now sitting in over 200 servers!

Big changes have come, the bot now supports Discord slash commands. This should make interacting with the bot much easier.
However, if the slash commands do not appear in your server, the bot may need to reinvite to the server.

The individual stat commands have not been moved to slash, and have had their functionality removed. 

We are on github now! Better late then never right? Link to the repo: https://github.com/Special-Sharpie/HockeyStatsBot

Command Updates:
    No commands changed this time around, just some clean up and error prevention.

New features:
    All commands are now slash commands, giving all command and options description as you use them, as well as some options having choice to simplify usage.
    singlestats has been split into goalies and skater, to simplify their usage.
